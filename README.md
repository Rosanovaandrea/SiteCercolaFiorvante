Hi, this is a spring react project that will be used for a massage center prenotation managing, an alert, this is not in production ready state and all the configurations are placeholders for test on my local,
theese will not be the the production configurations, i hope that this git repo ccut be a prove for my skills,or mi failings, thanks to all!

i will update with good documentation after with use of javadoc.

At this point i made the authentication with jwt and spring security, bussiness class for the manage of customers, service, reservations and day reservations, a class to manage the insert of images 
with rollback funtion and some early integration tests. 

I will made an integration for redis cache, a more robust approach with tdd metology for complete the test(I started to use its with the new features integration), the finalizing of front-end 
with react, and a good javadoc documentations.
